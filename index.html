          <p>"Jimmy Page is the musician by whom all other musicians are measured. Every guitar player wants to sound like him, every producer wants to capture the sounds he captured. He is a genuine music legend, and a recent BBC poll, which placed Led Zeppelin above even The Beatles, only underlines it. And, tantalisingly, the prospect of a new Jimmy Page project suggests that the man still has something up his sleeve. I can't wait to hear what it is."</p>
